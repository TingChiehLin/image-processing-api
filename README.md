# Image Processing API

This project aims to give you a real-world scenario in which you would read and write to your disk via a Node.js express server rather than a database. 

The project you create serves two purposes: to prepare you for setting up scalable code and architecture for real-world projects and tie together some of the most popular middleware and utilities found in Node.js projects.

###Requirement

- The scripts needed to test/start/build your application
- Any endpoints that should be accessed to test
  that you have created the required functionality
- The reviewer should be able to delete your thumbnail
  images and see them recreated when accessing
  the appropriate endpoints, and then see that
  they are not being recreated
